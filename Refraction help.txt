Refraction is a game based highly on trial-and-error and teaching the basics of circuits and light refraction.

You will begin with a single refractive index at your disposal: Vacuum. You must use the circuit game to unlock more indices to bend the path of light on the 'game' screen before time runs out.

In the circuit game you are given a circuit and a target current that you must reach in order to unlock one more refractive index. An active wire is light gray and an inactive wire is dark gray.

When you have unlocked enogh indices yo can go back to the 'game' screen and click on the layers to change their refractive index to one that you have unlocked.

You must bend the light from your starting point to the end point on the bottom of the screen.

Good luck!

Drawing pad: Allows you to draw on the screen to help with equations.

Calculator: Provides an in-game calculator to assist in calculating the magnitude and direction.

Formulae: The formulae screen provides all the formulae that are available from research to help you with the game.
