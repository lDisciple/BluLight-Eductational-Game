 ni x sin(i) = nr x sin(r)¿
Refraction is the bending of light when a wave travels from a less dense medium to a more dense medium.

Snells law is used to calculate the change in direction (degrees) of refracted light.

Where:
ni = The refrative index of the medium that the wave enters from.
i = the angle of the incident wave to the component perpindicular to the plane of refraction.
nr = The refrative index of the medium that the wave enters.
r = the angle of the refracted wave to the component perpindicular to the plane of refraction.¿
