# BluLight-Eductational-Game
Grade 11 Project - Educational Physics game.

This is my Grade 11 CAPS project.
The topic was to create an educational game of some sorts whether text-based or graphical.
You will need the derby libraries. (Included in the compiled jars.)

Elements used:
- Networking: Syncing of research text files.
- 2D graphics: Created my own 2D graphics library based off Swing.
- Game design: Was exposed to game loops and the usage of sprites.
- File system manipulation.
- Database Design and Implementations: That was the focal point of this project althouh I went in embedded databases and persistence.


Notes:

A big problem was the need for component-based architecture of which I didnt know at the time of coding.

Project Instructions:
______________________________________________

Welcome to BluLight!

Instructions:
Freefall: Freefall is a calculation heavy game that tests your ability to apply equations quickly and effectively.
Refraction: Refraction is a trial-and-error based game that teaches you the basics of light refraction and circuitry.
Research: Research is the method of viewing all your acquired research.

Bugs:
- Pathfinding for circuit game is not accurate to real life circuitry although it does display uniformity that allows the game to operate efficiently still.
- Works only on Windows

Post due date: (2017-10)
- Typo in a popup...
- Bad understanding of MAC addresses.
- Can be used on Linux but the C: folder needs to be deleted after each run, destroying the embedded database.
