Freefall is a highly involved physics based game that requires a high level knowledge of equations of motions and the ability to apply them quickly.

You will be given a falling box and you will able to adjust its velocity as it falls. The goal of the game is to get the box through a hole below the box. The gap is very small and requires extreme precision.

You start the game on the 'Game' screen where a box will begin falling and stop.
Two textboxes will appear that you can enter a magnitude and direction which you can the select as your desired direction or magnitude with the adjacent buttons.

The box will then continue to fall with the new velocity added. If the box falls through the hole then you will get a point, if not you lose.
If you are able to get the box through the hole within 2 minute 30 seconds then you get 2 points.

You are given the displacements of the block to the target hole and the velocities of the block to allow you to calculate the magnitude and direction.

Good luck!
